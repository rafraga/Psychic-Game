This is the Psychic Game, a little game in javascript/bootstrap/jquery.

In order to play it, just right-click with your mouse in the blank field in the line that starts with "Type one key at a time in the following field" and press a key from A to Z, trying to guess which key the computer will pick.

The computer will randomly pick a letter from A to Z as well before each try, so you are trying to guess which one it chooses.

You have 10 tries per game.

This project is part of the homework given at the UCLA Coding Bootcamp program (2018), class UCLAWES201802FSF3, and it's very useful to learn things such as functions in javascript and jquery, as well as bootstrap for the html part.
